        "description1":"Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Discipline of ICE started its academic activities with only 20 undergraduate students in academic session 2017- 2018.  But with the raising demand for students to get admitted in CSE Discipline we have started taking 40 students at the undergraduate level starting from session 2018-2019. Currently, we have 4 batches running. With the starting of our institution we valued quality of education and the environment of education. We have enriched lab facilities. There are software lab, hardware lab, network lab and more exclusively for CSE department.",
        "description2":"The computer science and engineering curriculum is focused on the study of the hardware, software, and theoretical aspects of high-speed computing devices. It is also concerned with the application of these devices to scientific, technological, and business problems. A bachelor’s degree in computer science and engineering gives students a basic understanding of the discipline. The degree prepares students for graduate work or for various industrial, governmental, and business positions involving the use of computers. The computer science graduate program offers coursework from a broad spectrum of theoretical and specific computer science applications, combined with research opportunities in nearly all areas of the field.",
        "description3":"The CSE department offers courses in the following areas: algorithms and theoretical computer science; numerical, parallel, and high-performance computing; distributed computing and systems; artificial intelligence, robotics, and computer vision; databases and data mining; human-computer interaction and information systems; graphics and visualization; software engineering and programming languages; computer architecture and compilers; networking; and computer security.List of faculty member. The Imperial Computer Access Nation (ICAN) is the computer club for all the students of CSE department. Apart from the educational knowledge, students are enlightened with latest news and information of technology. CSE department of ICE has arranged multiple co-curricular activities, seminars and workshops for building up good environment for newbie seeking inspiration. Besides the education there is arrangement for field trips.",
